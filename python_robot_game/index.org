* Code Organization
** Modules
   - Robot
     Responsible for moving and drawing the robot. Also, it is responsible for collision detection
   - Board
     Responsible for drawing / clearing the board
   - Bomb
     Responsible for storing bomb coordinates and drawing it on the window
   - Defuse Code
     Responsible for storing the coordinates of a defuse code and drawing it on the window
   - Defuse Count
     Responsible for managing the number of defuse codes remaining on the screen. It is also responsible for reinitializing counts across levels
   - Score
     Responsible for storing and displaying the current score of the player
   - Game
     It is responsible for the entire game logic. It creates other objects and starts the loop for handling key strokes, calls corresponding
     update and draw functions, and finally exit the game.
* Class Decomposition
   - There are 8 classes in all. One class is there for each of the modules described above.
   - GameOver class extends Exception and is responsible for propagating this information from Robot / Game module to the GameLogic segment.
** Class Methods
   - Robot
     - move(self, x, y)
       Moves the robot x distance in X direction and y distance in Y direction
     - checkCollisioin(self, coordinates)
       Checks if the robot is colliding with the given coordinate
     - draw(self, window)
       Draws the robot in the window provided
   - Board
     - draw(self)
       Refreshes the board, forcing items to be drawn
     - clear(self)
       Clears all contents of the board except for the border
   - Bomb
     - draw(self)
       Draws the bomb in the window provied at (x, y) location at which the bomb was created
   - DefuseCode
     - draw(self)
       Draw the defuse code in the window provided at (x, y) location at which the defuse code was created
   - DefuseCount
     - \_\_sub\_\_(self, value)
       Reduces the value of the defuse count by value
     - reset(self)
       Resets the defuse count for the next level
     - draw(self, window)
       Draws the current defuse count at the top of the given window
   - Score
     - \_\_add\_\_(self, value)
       Adds value to the current score
     - draw(self, window)
       Draws the current score at the top of the given window
   - Game
     - loop
       Creates game objects and starts the loop. It runs while update returns true. On returning false, it exits
     - initLevel
       Initializes all objects the next level
     - update
       Listens for key and updates all object
   - GameOver
     - No methods. Only inherits Exception class to make it an Exception Type
* Advantages
** Helpful Design
   - Modular code organizes the objects in a way that each object handles it's own responsiblity. We can easily design
     each component independently and making it the way it should behave, then all that is left is integration of various modules.
   - It also helps in debugging as pin-pointing errors in particular modules. Then the particular module needs to be debugged
     and not all the code.
** Flexible Design
   - The design is flexible enough to reuse for a different GUI / game with a slightly different logic. On changing the GUI, all that
     needs to change is the draw function of each of the classes / modules. On changing the logic, the update function of the game is
     the only thing that will need to change. It is agnostic to minor changes in GUI / logic.
** Miscellaneous
*** Control Flow
    - The main creates an object of the Game class, and calls it's loop. When the loop begins, it creates various objects required
      for the game. And Keeps calling update function while the game is running. The update function, listens for various key strokes
      and calls corresponding updates on the game objects. It returs False when the game is over.
    - Logic resides in the update function of the Game class.
** Extra features
   - The game has various level. The number of defuse codes increase as the level increases.
   - For each level, game resets the position of the robot to the top.
   - For each level, the game initially waits for the user to press the key and the robot does not start moving on its own
